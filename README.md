# SuiSynth.XYZ

**SuiSynth** is a decentralized synthetic asset protocol on **Sui** offering up to 4x leverage via a lending-pool model with AI-optimized risk management. Users can mint synthetic assets by providing collateral, or borrow with leverage to gain amplified exposure to real-world assets without the recurring funding rates typical of perpetual exchanges. Real-time price feeds are secured by **Switchboard Oracle**. With SuiSynth, traders gain capital-efficient exposure to global markets while maintaining full control of their positions.
